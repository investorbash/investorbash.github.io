      <h5><b>OUR STORY</b></h5>
      <h2 style="color: #212529;"><b>After 30 years, we are still deeply rooted in human values and <br /> sustainability.</b></h2>
      <h3  style="color: #212529;"><b >Sustainability, innovation, community, teamwork and respect.</b></h3>
      <p>
        These core values permeate everything we do at Pacific Market International – from how we design
        products to our commitment to our customers and the broader communities we serve. For more than
        30 years, we’ve designed and manufactured sustainable products that revolutionize how people eat
        and drink on the go.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1983, Rob Harris launched PMI with a modest investment of $1,200, a curiosity about international
        trade and a vision to make quality and sustainable products for the sports and recreation markets. Fast
        forward to today and PMI is the leading global manufacturer of sustainable food and beverage
        container solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our two most recognizable brands, Stanley® and Aladdin®, both have a heritage spanning more than a
        century and are sold around the world. Another rapidly growing area of focus for PMI is our partnership
        with Starbucks and other select global retailers to create private label products.
      </p>
      <p>
        Headquartered in Seattle, PMI has offices in Bentonville, Shanghai, Amsterdam, Manila, San
        Francisco, Shenzhen, and Rio de Janeiro, PMI is made up of more than 1,100 passionate individuals
        united in our mission to deliver great sustainable products, make a positive impact on the environment
        and have fun along the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Collectively, we’re driven by our common values of sustainability, community, innovation, and customer
         value. Those values permeate everything we do, from the products we design, to how we treat the
          people who make them.
